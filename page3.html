                        I want to build a future with. Every single word I say and every action I take 
                        should reflect how much you matter to me. There's no excuse good enough for hurting you.

                        I won't make this mistake again. I'm going to do better, be better, and show you 
                        every day why you mean the world to me. You deserve nothing less than my absolute best.
